FrankenScan uses the Ryvencore library.

FrankenScan currently only has 6 modules.

While the concept behind FrankenScan is based on ScanFlow (University of Melbourne project) the code has been started from scratch and so is not subject to any copyright relating to ScanFlow.

Dependencies:

Ryvencore (https://github.com/leon-thomm/ryvencore-qt),
Pyside2, pyvistaqt, matplotlib

This project uses the Fugue Icon set as placeholder icons.
